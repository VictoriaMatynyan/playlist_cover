# Simple cover for a Playlist

## Review

Playlist cover was made during the introductory course at [Yandex Praktikum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/) for web-developers.
Originally it was without any classes and BEM, so I updated the cover accordingly.
Blocks of classes are devided according to BEM-Nested.

## Applied decisions in Project No.3:

* HTML5 and CSS3 coding;
* BEM methodology in file structure (nested).

In the recent future I'm thinking of making it a bit interactive.
